## 👋 Hey there!

Hi! I'm **aki hayaka**, and I'm still learning how to build web3 applications. This is one of my early projects, so please bear with me if you find any bugs or rough edges! 😅

This checklist was created to help myself (and hopefully others!) navigate the Arc Testnet ecosystem. If you're new to blockchain like me, this tool makes it super easy to:
- ✅ Track your learning progress
- 🦊 Set up MetaMask with one click
- 💸 Send test transactions
- 📝 Deploy your first smart contract
- 🤝 Interact with deployed contracts

---

## 🌟 What This Does

This is a **visual checklist** for completing essential Arc Testnet tasks. Think of it as a guided tour for blockchain beginners!

### Features:
- **Progress Tracking** - See how many tasks you've completed
- **One-Click MetaMask Setup** - Automatically adds Arc Testnet to your wallet
- **Easy Send Transactions** - Simple UI for sending USDC to friends
- **Smart Contract Deployment** - Deploy contracts without writing code
- **Interactive Contract Functions** - Call functions with just a button click
- **Local Storage** - Your progress saves automatically

---

## 🎯 Tasks Included

1. **Claim Testnet USDC** - Get free test tokens from the faucet
2. **Setup MetaMask for Arc** - Add Arc Testnet network automatically
3. **Send Test Transaction** - Practice sending USDC to other addresses
4. **Deploy Smart Contract** - Deploy a SimpleStorage contract
5. **Interact with Contract** - Store and retrieve numbers on-chain
6. **Share Experience** - Tweet about your journey!

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

I'm learning these technologies:
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Frontend basics
- **Web3.js concepts** - Blockchain interactions
- **MetaMask Integration** - Wallet connections
- **Solidity** - Smart contract language (very beginner level!)

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Use it Online (Easiest!)
Just visit the live site: [https://aki-hayaka-arc.vercel.app/]

### Option 2: Run Locally
If you want to explore the code:

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/akihayakaa/arc-testnet-checklist.git

# Navigate to the folder
cd arc-testnet-checklist

# Open index.html in your browser
# That's it! No build steps needed 🎉
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Prerequisites:
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Brave recommended)
- MetaMask extension installed ([Get it here](https://metamask.io/download/))
- Some patience with a fellow learner! 😊

### Steps:
1. **Open the website**
2. **Start with Task 1** - Claim testnet USDC
3. **Follow each task in order** - They build on each other
4. **Check off tasks as you complete them** - Progress saves automatically
5. **Try the Deploy page** - Click "Deploy Smart Contract" to access advanced features

### Pro Tips:
- Use the "Send to Frens" feature to test transactions (you can even use my wallet address that's suggested!)
- The SimpleStorage contract is perfect for learning - it just stores a number
- All data is stored locally in your browser, so you can pick up where you left off

## 🐛 Known Issues

I'm aware of these issues and learning how to fix them:
- [ ] Sometimes the deployment needs a page refresh to show up
- [ ] Error messages could be more helpful
- [ ] Mobile layout could be improved
- [ ] Need better loading indicators

**Found a bug?** Please let me know! I'm learning and appreciate any feedback. 🙏
